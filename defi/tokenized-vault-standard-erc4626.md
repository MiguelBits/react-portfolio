# Tokenized Vault Standard ERC4626

### What is the ERC-4626 token contract standard?

The ERC-4626 is a contract standard for yield-bearing tokens issued by Vaults or other protocols. This ERC-4626 contract standard extends the [ERC-20 token](https://cryptomarketpool.com/erc20-token-solidity-smart-contract/) standard and can be implemented however needed. The Ethereum ERC-4626 is an extension of the [ERC-20 contract](https://cryptomarketpool.com/erc20-token-solidity-smart-contract/) and standardizes:

1. Deposits and withdrawals
2. Functions to calculate the amount of vault token and underlying token required for deposits or withdrawals
3. Interface to determine the underlying
4. Events

Additionally different protocols can interact with an ERC-4626 contract as long as the implementation complies with the standards interface.
