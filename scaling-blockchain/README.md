  How can we scale blockchains from 20 transactions per second (Ethereum rates)
  to 24,000 transactions per second ( Visa rates ) ? ... While also maintaining
  low transaction fees.

# Scaling Blockchain

* **Faster Consensus:** modern blockchains, use different and faster consensus algorithms that can handle many more _tx/sec_; `( e.g., Solana, Polkadot, Avalanche )`
* **Payment channels:** most transactions are off chain Peer-to-Peer; `( e.g., Lightening Network)`
* **Layer 2 approaches:** batch many transactions into a single transaction.`( e.g., zkRollup, optimistic Rollup)`
* **Side chains:** Polygon and others
* Many other ideas ...
