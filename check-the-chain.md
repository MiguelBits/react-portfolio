# Check the chain

Everything on the blockchain is public, which means that every person can go and check every transaction for themselves. Any questions? Check the chain.

## Block Explorers&#x20;

A block explorer is an online blockchain browser that can show the details of all transactions that have ever happened on a blockchain network.&#x20;

There are block explorers for Bitcoin and for individual altcoins. Some block explorers can be used on multiple different networks, while others are only for one specific blockchain. A BTC block explorer, for example, would only be able to find information from the Bitcoin network. It can be used to find any specific transaction or view the recent history of the chain more generally. Below youâ€™ll find some links to well known block explorers.
