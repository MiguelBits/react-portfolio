# Smart Contracts

### Contract programming model

* **Contract Class:** Defines the program code and storage variables for a contract;
* **Storage fields:** variables stored by the contract;
* **Contract object:** an instance of the class living on the blockchain;
* **Functions/methods:** can be invoked to run the given code, updating the state of the contract;
* **Access control:** Use "require()" to cancel the transaction if it is not authorized. You can inspect the caller that invoked the function;
* **Composition:** interaction between multiple contracts;
