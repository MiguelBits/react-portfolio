# Fungible Tokens

Fungible tokens or assets are **divisible and non-unique**.

Familiarity with the concept of fungibility in economics might help one better understand fungible and nonfungible tokens. The only difference is that crypto tokens express their fungibility property through a code script.

Fungible tokens or assets are divisible and non-unique. For instance, fiat currencies like the dollar are fungible: A $1 bill in New York City has the same value as a $1 bill in Miami. A fungible token can also be a cryptocurrency like Bitcoin: 1 BTC is worth 1 BTC, no matter where it is issued.&#x20;
