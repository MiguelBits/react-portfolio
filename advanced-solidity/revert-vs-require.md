# Revert() vs Require()

Using `revert()` instead of `require()` is generally not recommended for simple condition checks, as `require()` is more concise and easier to read. However, there are some cases where you might prefer to use `revert()`:

1. Custom error handling: If you need to perform additional actions or custom error handling when a condition is not met, using `revert()` with an `if` statement can provide more flexibility.
2. Complex conditions: If you have multiple conditions to check, and you want to revert with different error messages depending on which condition fails, using separate `if` statements followed by `revert()` might make the code more readable.
3. Code organization: In some cases, using `revert()` might make the code more organized, especially if you have a separate function to handle errors and want to maintain a consistent coding style.

In summary, while `require()` is the recommended approach for simple condition checks due to its conciseness and readability, you may choose to use `revert()` in situations that call for more complex error handling or when you want to maintain a consistent coding style.
