# DeFi

## Decentralized Finance

A [DEX](https://www.coinbase.com/learn/crypto-basics/what-is-a-dex) (aka decentralized exchange) is a platform that enables trading your tokens without an intermediary (e.g. centralized exchange).

There are two main types of [DEX](https://www.coinbase.com/learn/crypto-basics/what-is-a-dex)s: **Order book based** and **Liquidity pool based.**

### Order Book Based DEX <a href="#881e" id="881e"></a>

An order book based [DEX](https://www.coinbase.com/learn/crypto-basics/what-is-a-dex)s operate similarly to [CEX](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/centralized-exchange-cex%C3%BA%C5%B1)s, where users can buy and sell orders at their chosen prices. The main difference is that in a [DEX](https://www.coinbase.com/learn/crypto-basics/what-is-a-dex) the assets are held in the users wallets, not in exchange wallets.
