# 4. User Facing tools

## Managing assets

#### Types of wallets:

* Cloud (e.g., Coinbase, Binance): cloud holds secret keys ... like a bank.
* Client stored keys:
  * laptop/phone: Electrum, MetaMask, ..
  * hardware: Trezor, Ledger, ...
  * paper: print all secret keys on paper
* Hybrid: non-custodial cloud wallet (using threshold signatures)

One rule of thumb here is:

\-> Not your keys, not your crypto ... but lose key â‡’ lose funds
