# 1. Consensus Layer

### Properties:

A **public** append-only data structure that provides:

* **Persistence:** once added, data can never be removed; \*
* **Safety:** all honest participants have the same data; \*
* **Liveness:** honest participants can add new transactions;
* **Open:** anyone can add data (no authentication);

\*(achieved by replication)

## How does it work in practice?

The consensus mechanism allows users in the blockchain to do transactions without relying on a central authority to verify the said transaction.

Each user in the blockchain has a private key to sign their transactions. So after the creation of a transaction, the user must sign its transaction before sending it to the blockchain network, which is basically a collection of miners.

The transaction is then received by the blockchain network validators, these are called miners, then they propagate the information of the transaction, replicating it throughout the P2P network.

After this there's a leader election mechanism, where one of the miners gets elected, this leader will be creating the next block in the chain.&#x20;

The leader takes all pending transactions, also called all the transactions in the _mempool_, creates a block out of them. And then he posts this new block onto the blockchain. Since he did this work to create the block he will be rewarded.

All the other miners then validate this new block, if it is invalid the block is treated as if it was never posted to the blockchain.

This process is then repeated all over again, and this is how a blockchain evolves.
